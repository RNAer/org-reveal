* Reveal.js and Org-Reveal
  - *Reveal.js* is a tool for creating good-looking HTML presentations.
    See https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/. \\
    For an example of reveal.js presentation, click [[http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/][here]].
  - *Org-Reveal* exports your [[http://orgmode.org][Org]] documents to reveal.js presentations.\\
    With Org-reveal, you can create beautiful presentations with 3D
    effects from simple but powerful Org contents.

* Repository
  This repository is modified from [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal][Yujie Wen's repo]] (thanks!)

  Besides some minor code formating, the changes include:

  - changed some variable settings. Some variables are removed from global customization.
  - removed =reveal_postamble= and =reveal_preamble=. It seems useless to me and reveal.js does not handle them very well.
  - added functionality to set attributes for the title slide.
  - added functions to handle footnote export.
  - added shorcut to insert speaker notes.
  - changed original mathjax related code for utilizing the mathjax code in =ox-html.el=. This has 2 advantages:
    1) reduce code redundancy
    2) the same document can be exported both to html or reveal.js without changes
  - other minor changes.

* Requirements and Installation
  - Reveal.js.
  - Latest org-mode.
  - ox-reveal.el.
  - And, of course, emacs.

** Obtain Reveal.js
   - Download Reveal.js packages from [[https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/][here]].
   - Extract Reveal.js folders from the downloaded zip file.
   - If you do not wish you download reveal.js and want to use a CDN version, see the section _Set the location of Reveal.js_

** Obtain org-mode
   - Org-reveal relies on the Org-mode export frame work. Pre-packaged org-mode may be out-of-date has not been tested.
   - If not sure, use the latest development codes from git repository.

     You can install it in Emacs with =M-x package-install= and then type =org=.

     Or get it from github:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       git clone git://orgmode.org/org-mode.git
     #+END_SRC
     Then Follow the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-build-system.html][online instruction]] to build and install Org-mode.

** Obtain Org-reveal
   - Download latest Org-reveal package from [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal][the Org-reveal GitHub page]]. Or clone the GitHub repository:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       git clone https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal.git
     #+END_SRC
   - Copy =ox-reveal.el= to the Org-mode installation directory.
   - Add the following statement to your =.emacs= file.
     #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
       (require 'ox-reveal)
     #+END_SRC

* Configuration and Usage
  You can export this file with =C-c C-e R R= to see the effects of following config. Before that, make sure the path settings at the head of the file is right for you.
  - Press =s= to show speaker notes
  - Press =ESC= to enter the slide overview.
  - Hold down =Alt= and click on any element to zoom in on it using zoom.js. =Alt= + =click= anywhere to zoom back out.
  - Press =b= or =.= on your keyboard to enter the 'paused' mode. This mode is helpful when you want to take distracting slides off the screen during a presentation.

** Set the Location of Reveal.js
   Org-reveal must know where Reveal.js is on your computer before
   exporting Org contents. The location of Reveal.js is the path to
   the top directory of Reveal.js packages, the one which contains
   file *README.md*, but *not* the one contains file reveal.js.

   The default location is current directory of the org file.

   Change the value of variable =org-reveal-root= will change the location
   globally. For example, add the following statement to your .emacs
   file:
   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
     (setq org-reveal-root "/Users/zech/Dropbox/git/reveal.js")
   #+END_SRC

   By setting option =REVEAL_ROOT=, the location is only affected
   within the Org file.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     #+REVEAL_ROOT: /Users/zech/Dropbox/git/reveal.js
   #+END_SRC

** First Try
   - To wake-up Org-reveal now, type =M-x load-library=, then type =ox-reveal=.
   - Now you can export this manual into Reveal.js presentation by typing =C-c C-e R R=.
   - Open the generated "Readme.html" in your browser and enjoy the cool slides.

** The HLevel
   Org-reveal maps each heading and its contents to one Reveal.js
   slides. Since Reveal.js arranges slides into a 2-dimentional matrix,
   Org-reveal use a *HLevel* value to decide map headings to hozirontal
   or vertical slides.

   * Headings of level less or equal to HLevel are mapped to hozirontal
     slides.
   * Headings of deeper levels are mapped to vertical slides.

   HLevel's default value is 1, means only level 1 headings are arranged
   horizontally, deeper headings are mapped to vertical slides below its
   parent level 1 heading.

*** HLevel's effects on Slides Layout
    Assume we have a simple Org file as below:
    #+BEGIN_SRC org
      * H1
      * H2
      ** H2.1
      *** H2.1.1
      * H3
    #+END_SRC

    If HLevel is 1, the default value, headings H2.1 and H2.1.1 will
    be mapping to vertical slides below the slides of heading H2.

    [[file:images/hlevel.png]]

    If HLevel is changed to 2, slide of heading H2.1 will be changed
    to the main hozirontal queue, and slide of heading H2.1.1 will be
    a vertical slide below it.

    [[file:images/hlevel2.png]]

*** Configure HLevel's Value
    * Setting Org files local HLevel using =#+OPTIONS= tag =reveal_hlevel=.
      #+BEGIN_SRC org
	#+OPTIONS: reveal_hlevel:2
      #+END_SRC

** Force Split
   If one headings has too many things to fit into one slide, you can
   split the contents into multiple vertical slides manually, by inserting

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     #+REVEAL_HTML: SPLIT
   #+END_SRC

#+REVEAL_HTML: SPLIT

   Now a new slide begins after =#+REVEAL_HTML: SPLIT= keyword.

** Select Theme and Transition Style and Speed
    Themes and transition styles are set globally throughout the whole
    file by setting options =REVEAL_THEME=, =REVEAL_TRANS=, and =REVEAL_SPEED=
    in your org-mode file.

    For an example, please check the heading part of this document.

    Please check reveal.js documentation for available themes and transition styles.

** Slide Size
   Reveal.js scales slides to best fit the display resolution. But in case
   the auto-sizes are not satisfiable, you can specify the desired size by
   =#+OPTIONS= tag =reveal_width= and =reveal_height=.

   The scaling behavior can also be contrainted by setting following
   =#+OPTIONS= tags:

   * =reveal_margin= a float number, the factor of empty area surrounding slide contents.
   * =reveal_min_scale= a float number, the minimun scaling down ratio.
   * =reveal_max_scale= a float number, the maximum scaling up ratio.

** Slide Numbering
   Enabled by default. To deactivate slide numbers:
   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     #+OPTIONS: reveal_slide_number:nil
   #+END_SRC
** Slide of outline
   The following setting only shows the outermost headline.
   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     #+OPTIONS: toc:1
   #+END_SRC

   You can disable it with:
   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     #+OPTIONS: toc:nil
   #+END_SRC
** Disable Heading Numbers
   To remove the section numbers on titles of slides (default):
   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     #+OPTIONS: num:nil
   #+END_SRC
** Set low-level headlines as list rather than slides
   If you set like following, all headlines lower than level 3 will be exported as list item
   instead of stand alone slides.
   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     #+OPTIONS: H:3
   #+END_SRC
** Other Misc Settings on the Presentation
   Reveal.js provides other capabilities to configure slides.

   They can be turned on/off by setting =#+OPTIONS= tags to =nil= or =t=:
   - =reveal_control= : Show/hide browsing control pad.
   - =reveal_progress= : Show/hide progress bar.
   - =reveal_history= : Enable/disable slide history track.
   - =reveal_center= : Enable/disable vertical centering of slide.
   - =reveal_keyboard= : Enable/disable keyboard navigation.
   - =reveal_overview= : Enable/disable thumbnail overview.

    For an example, please refer to the heading part of this file.

** Fragmented Contents
    Make contents fragmented (show up one-by-one) by setting option =ATTR_REVEAL= with
    property ":frag frag-style", as illustrated below.

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
    Paragraphs can be fragmented.

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
    Items can be fragmented, too.

    Availabe fragment styles are:
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag grow
    * grow
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag shrink
    * shrink
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
    * roll-in
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag fade-out
    * fade-out
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag highlight-red
    * highlight-red
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag highlight-green
    * highlight-green
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag highlight-blue
    * highlight-blue

** Set Individual Slide Background
   Slide background can be set to a color, an image or a repeating image
   array by setting heading properties.

*** Single Colored Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :reveal_data_bg: #543210
   :END:

    Set property =reveal_data_bg= to either an RGB color value, or any
    supported CSS color format.

    #+BEGIN_SRC org
      *** Single Colored Background
	  :PROPERTIES:
	  :reveal_data_bg: #543210
	  :END:
    #+END_SRC

*** Single Image Background
    :PROPERTIES:
    :reveal_data_bg: images/whale.jpg
    :reveal_data_bg_trans: slide
    :END:

    Set property =reveal_data_bg= to an URL of background image.
    Set property =reveal_data_bg_trans= to =slide= to make background image
    sliding rather than fading.
    #+BEGIN_SRC org
    *** Single Image Background
	:PROPERTIES:
	:reveal_data_bg: images/whale.jpg
	:reveal_data_bg_trans: slide
	:END:
    #+END_SRC

*** Repeating Image Background
    :PROPERTIES:
    :reveal_data_bg: images/whale.jpg
    :reveal_data_bg_size: 400px
    :reveal_data_bg_repeat: repeat
    :END:

    Resize background image by setting property =reveal_data_bg_size= to a number.

    Set property =reveal_data_bg_repeat= to =repeat= to repeat
    image on the background.
    #+BEGIN_SRC org
    *** Repeating Image Background
	:PROPERTIES:
	:reveal_data_bg: images/whale.jpg
	:reveal_data_bg_size: 400px
	:reveal_data_bg_repeat: repeat
	:END:
    #+END_SRC

** Set Extra Individual Slide Attribute
   :PROPERTIES:
   :reveal_data_extra:  style="background-color:green; font-size:99px"
   :END:

   Set property =reveal_data_extra= to headings to add any necessary attributes
   to slides.

   For example, you can use it to set the background color and the size of the text - such as
   this very slide.

** Set Data State for Individual Slide
   :PROPERTIES:
   :reveal_data_state: custemevent
   :END:

   Set property =reveal_data_state= to headings to change this slide's
   display style, as illustrated here:
   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ** Data State
	:PROPERTIES:
	:reveal_data_state: custemevent
	:END:
   #+END_SRC
   +Availabe data states are: =alert=, =blackout=, =soothe=.+
** Footnote
   Footnote can be defined and exported to each slide. Inline footnote is recommended.

   For example, org-mode is awesome project [fn:: http://orgmode.org/] and org-reveal is
   awesome [fn:: https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal & https://github.com/RNAer/org-reveal] too.

   This is great for listing citations on the slide.
** Source Codes
   Org-reveal use Org-Babel to highlight source codes.

   #+BEGIN_SRC python
     >>> if x < 0:
     ...     x = 0
     ...     print 'Negative changed to zero'
     ... elif x == 0:
     ...     print 'Zero'
     ... elif x == 1:
     ...     print 'Single'
     ... else:
     ...     print 'More'
   #+END_SRC

   If you saw odd indentation, please set variable =org-html-indent=
   to =nil= and export again.

** MathJax
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: heading-of-mj
  :END:

   ${n! \over k!(n-k)!} = {n \choose k}$

   Latex equation are renderred in native HTML5 contents.

   *IMPORTANT*: Displaying equations requires internet connection to
   [[mathjax.org]] or local MathJax installation.

   *IMPORTANT*: For local MathJax installation, set option =HTML_MATHJAX= to locate the URL
   pointing to the local MathJax location. Search org-mode documentation for details.

   You can set =#+OPTIONS= tag =reveal_mathjax= to =nil= to disable the mathjax rendering.
** Raw HTML in Slides
   Besides the Org contents, you can embed raw HTML contents
   into slides by placing a =#+REVEAL_HTML= keyword.

   Now break time, watch two videos:

   #+REVEAL_HTML: <video width="400" height="300" controls> <source src="images/big_buck_bunny.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>
   #+REVEAL_HTML: <iframe width="400" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BYQaD2CAi9A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
   #+REVEAL_HTML: SPLIT
   or embed a webpage inside a slide:
   #+REVEAL_HTML: <object data="http://emperor.colorado.edu/master/make_emperor/emperor_output/index.html" type="text/html" width="1600" height="900"> <a href="http://emperor.colorado.edu/master/make_emperor/emperor_output/index.html"> Emperor PCoA plot </a> failed to load...</p> </object>
** Speaker Notes
   Reveal.js supports speaker notes, which are displayed in a seperate
   browser window. Press 's' on slide windows will pop up an window
   displaying current slide, next slide and the speak notes on current
   slide.

   Org-reveal recognize texts between =#+BEGIN_NOTES= and =#+END_NOTES=
   as speaker notes. See the example below.

   You can type =<n= and then =TAB= to insert empty note block.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
    * Heading 1
      Some contents.
      ,#+BEGIN_NOTES
	Enter speaker notes here.
      ,#+END_NOTES
   #+END_SRC

      #+REVEAL_HTML: SPLIT

   Due to a bug in Reveal.js, sometimes the speaker notes window
   shows only blank screens. A workaround to this issue is to put
   the presentation HTML file into the Reveal.js root directory and
   reopen it in the brower.

   It is recommended to download reveal.js and run grunt server locally
   for this. See reveal.js documentation for details.

** Extra Stylesheets and Javascripts
   Set =REVEAL_EXTRA_CSS= to a stylesheet file path in order to load extra custom
   styles after loading a theme:
   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     #+REVEAL_EXTRA_CSS: url-to-custom-stylesheet.css
   #+END_SRC

   Similarly, set =REVEAL_EXTRA_JS= to the url of extra reveal.js dependent
   script if necessary:
   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     #+REVEAL_EXTRA_JS: url-to-custom-script.js
   #+END_SRC

** Internal Links - jumping between slides
   You can create links pointings to a headline's text, or its
   custom-id, as the examples below:

   * jump to [[Speaker Notes]]: currently links to headline text does work properly.
   * [[#heading-of-mj][jump to MathJax]]: link to the headings with the specified =CUSTOM_ID= property.

** Org Table
   An example of how a table is exported in org-reveal:
   #+CAPTION: OTU Table
   #+TBLNAME: OTUS
   #+ATTR_HTML:
   | ID | OTU1 | OTU2 |
   |----+------+------|
   |  1 |   30 |    2 |
   |  2 |    0 |   70 |
** Checkbox on Org List
   An example of how checkbox before org list exported:
   - [X] book A
   - [ ] book B

* To-do
  * aware of =::=
  * currently change fragment style between list items will break the whole list into smaller list and then break the consistent style.

* Acknowledgment
  Courtesy to:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
  * The powerful Org-mode,
  * the impressive Reveal.js,
  * and the precise MathJax
